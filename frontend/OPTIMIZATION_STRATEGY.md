# Frontend Optimization Strategy

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **React 19 Features**: Using `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` for search/filter operations to prevent UI blocking during expensive operations.

2. **Memoization Strategy**: Implementing `useMemo` for expensive calculations (arrays, objects) and `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

3. **Loading Strategy**: Client-side rendering with skeleton loading for immediate visual feedback and better perceived performance.

4. **Data Fetching**: React Query with 5-minute stale time and infinite scrolling for efficient data management and reduced server load.

5. **Accessibility**: Comprehensive ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and high contrast support for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

6. **Bundle Optimization**: Route-based code splitting and tree shaking to minimize initial bundle size.

7. **Performance Monitoring**: Custom component to track render time, memory usage, and accessibility score in development.

8. **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and graceful fallbacks for better user experience.

9. **Future-Ready**: Prepared for React Server Components when stable, with current CSR approach for dynamic content.
